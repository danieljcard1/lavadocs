## Overview



In this presentation, Matt Reiner explains how to use common content creation skills to build a business case to secure funding for content projects. 



He recommends you _know your audience_ and try to connect with them on things they care about. A common audience for business cases are business leaders, and some things they often care about are:



* Business Impact: How will the project impact the business in a positive way?



* Duplicate Efforts: How will the project help to avoid a duplication of efforts?



* You: How will the project support employees and prevent turnover?



He also suggests you _learn the business_. You can do this by familiarizing yourself with the organization’s business plan/goals and then framing your business case by how it can aid in their achievement. You can also create an elevator pitch that explains the what and the why of your project, in case you have the opportunity to briefly connect with an organizational leader. 



Additionally, Reiner recommends you strategically _connect with teams_. You can connect with the marketing team to discover ideal moments of receptivity in which to pitch your project, and also to relate your work to the brand and the brand’s messaging at large. You can connect with the sales team in order to relate your project to the sales process and you can connect with the support team to align your project with user requests and feedback. 



In order to _bring these steps together_, collect relevant metrics, be helpful and practical, and finally, assemble your plan. Reiner’s suggested format for a business case can be broken down into eight parts:



* Executive Summary



Summarize what you’re asking for and why.



* SWOT Analysis



List the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.



* Business Description



Talk about where the company has been and how it can grow through this effort.



* Marketing Strategy



Lay out how you’re going to share the results of this effort internally and externally once it’s finished.



* Competitors Analysis



Explore the offerings of other organizations and push your unique selling proposition.



* Operations Overview



Share the plan for who will be involved in the effort, what tools they’ll need, and the time commitment needed from each.



* Product Plan



Dive into the nitty gritty of the effort, what it involves, what will change, and lay out the final result.



* Financial Plan



Share costs as far as you understand them and justify them if possible.

## Key takeaways

2. A comprehensive business case can be broken down into eight parts: _executive summary_, _SWOT analysis_, _business description_, _marketing strategy_, _competitors analysis_, _operations overview_, _product plan_, and _financial plan_.

## Reflection



*How does the presentation connect with or extend your work in this class?*



The technical communications skills learned in this class will likely require funding, if done in a professional capacity. Whether we like it or not, we may be called upon to justify this funding by creating and presenting a business case. This presentation simplified the business case creation process, and also provided tips for collaborations outside of the communications team.
