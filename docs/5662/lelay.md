# Kat Shereko's "Beyond Inclusion: The Importance of Accessible Web Content and Design"
**Contributed by Brian Le Lay**

## Overview
In this LavaCon on-demand presentation, [Kat Shereko](https://www.portent.com/blog/author/kshereko) (Organic Team Lead for [Portent](https://www.portent.com/)) discusses how companies might begin to optimize their content for accessible user experiences.

Shereko makes the case that by designing accessible content, companies make their products and services available to a range of users with disabilities, as well as users experiencing situational/temporary limitations. Shereko suggests that companies begin by choosing a desired conformance level, performing a content audit, and publishing an accessibility statement.

Finally, Shereko presents accessibility fundamentals assured to optimize the user experience.

## Key Takeaways
Content strategists interested in creating accessible user experiences should:

1. **Set clear accessibility goals.**
Content creators should identify current areas for improvement with respect to [WCAG conformance levels](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html) and begin to work toward making those improvements.

2. **Publish an accessibility statement.**
Content creators should consider publishing an [accessibility statement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/). The accessibility statement articulates and demonstrates the company's commitment to creating an accessible user experience. 

3. **Account for accessibility in design decisions.**
Content creators should be aware of how design decisions might affect accessibility. For example, the decision to skip a heading level may achieve the desired font size, but it creates a less accessible user experience for screen reader users.

## Reflection
Shereko's presentation is sure to raise content strategists' awareness of accessibility as a key consideration.

In WRIT 5662 "Writing with Digital Technologies," we have discussed the affordances and constraints of mass market content management systems. The default design styles imposed by these systems (as Shereko alluded to) raise for me a broader set of concerns regarding accessibility.

In particular, I'm wondering how mass market CMS' might be remade to encourage accessible design decisions. At a minimum, such systems might alter the default styles to avoid inaccessible workarounds, but this approach alone may be insufficient given the wide range of design preferences and brand guidelines that might lead content strategists to deviate from the defaults. I could imagine an interactive CMS system that provides immediate accessibility feedback to the designer.
