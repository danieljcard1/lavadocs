# Welcome to our Lavadocs!

As part of the courses WRIT 4662 and WRIT 5662 *Writing with Digital Technologies* we watched presentations from [LavaCon UX 2020](https://lavacon.org/2020/) and the University of Minnesota [Accessibility Ambassadors](https://mediaspace.umn.edu/playlist/dedicated/0_7hpbmbsa/1_cvf2u354).

We then built this website as part of our exploration of Markdown and static site generators. 

* Static site generator: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
* MkDocs Theme: [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
* Print plugin: [MkDocs Print Site](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-print-site-plugin)
