# UMN Accessibility Ambassadors Presentation Review

**Nicholas Van Orsdel - WRIT 4662W**

## Summary of the Accessible Google Docs Presentation

Amy Drayer, a web developer for the University of Minnesota (UMN) libraries, and Khaled Musa, an academic technologist with the UMN academic technology support services, both presented useful insight into what google docs can be used for as well as what it is limited to. Throughout the presentation, the core focus was on the structure of a document using google docs. Two docs were put together side by side to see the difference structure can have on accessibility while using google docs. The two presenters also touched on useful tools and advice for listeners to use in google docs on their own future projects.

## Key takeaways

Throughout the presentation, both speakers presented difference skills that can be extremely useful when using google docs. The three skills I’d like to highlight for key takeaways are the 
following:

* Headings format
* Color and contrast recommendations
* Header and footnote format

To begin, the biggest takeaway from the suggestions on the format for headings was to bold all headings within documents, and the exact size of the test for each heading style. For example, title headings should be 24pt and second headings should be 18pt. This was interesting to learn, as in the past I had used 24pt font for title headings but only 16pt font for second headings. Second, the advice was given never to rely on color to convey meaning. This was also an aspect that I had used before. The evidence was provided that the meaning behind a color choice may be lost in translation in the document, and I can definitely see the reader thinking of a different connection based on color choice. Thirdly, the presenters proposed that adding automated pagination to the header in a longer document helps the flow of a document. This was also a good tip to use something I haven't in the past.

## Reflection

After watching and reflecting on this presentation, I not only strengthened the prior knowledge I had before watching, but I also learned new tools that I can use in the future. I’m a strong believer that there is always room for improvement, and by reviewing something that I had not reviewed in some time, it most definitely will help with my document creation moving forward. If you want to strengthen your google doc skills, as well as learn new skills, click [here](https://mediaspace.umn.edu/playlist/dedicated/0_7hpbmbsa/1_rv5s1cus) to watch the presentation. In the near future, I will most definitely be using the tools that I learned in this presentation to create a more accessible document for any reader.
