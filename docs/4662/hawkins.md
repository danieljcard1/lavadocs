## Overview

Cognition results from our combined abilities to comprehend and retain

>**Cognition = Comprehend + Retain**

Every day, each of us stretches our capacity for content consumption.  The average American consumes 11.88 hours of content a day.  That is 50 bits per second!  Minimalism and topic based writing enables writers to deftly maneuver and capitalize on readers limited attention. 

In other words, we must respect the audience's time. 

*Minimalist Topic Based Authoring* requires authors to chunk information.  Authors should chunk information into topics that focus on just one of the readers' questions at a time.  When we keep topics specific they are easy to reorganize and remain connected yet independent. 

Product information typically falls into 3 main kinds of information topics:

1. Concept
 Explain in order to provide depth of understanding.
 
2.  Reference
 Information that the reader knows they can look up and therefore don't need to remember.
 
3. Task
 How-Tos and other instructional content.

Each topic has the same basic structure - they all have titles, short descriptions, and a body.  This triangular structure allows us to make our writing more searchable.   As a result, we are left with modules that we can arrange and rearrange however we see fit to match the audiences expectations - like [LEGOS](www.lego.com)!

## Key takeaways

### Data specs for the average American:
 - Hours = 11.88 
 - Words = 100,000 (23/sec)
 - Bytes = 34 GB
 - Face-to-Face conversations = 100 mb/sec
 - Touch = 11 million bytes/sec
 - Conscious Mind = 50 bytes/sec

### Imagine your audience and _edit, edit, edit_ to ensure you:

- Remove distractions
- Avoid stating the obvious
- Eliminate long complicated sentences
- Recognize the reader as an active participant

### Three main types of topics:

- Concept
- Reference 
- Task
  
### Each topic follows the same structure:

- Title
- Short Description
- Body

### Benefits of Minimalist Topic Based Authoring
For _Audience_:

- Readable from search
- Easy to get exact answers
- Higher user satisfaction

For _Authors_:

- Collaborative Writing
- Easy to manage
- Content sharing

## Reflection

The advice described in this LavaCon video is straightforward advice for writers across all genres.  Knowing, understanding, and respecting your audience is the first step to successful communication.  I like the simple structure Fraley and Summers present, and I believe tasks, concepts and references encompass pretty much all of the topics a typical reader will need. 

The really interesting part of the presentation was how it demonstrated the benefits of Minimal Topic Based Authoring for the author.  Busting the information we present into smaller chunks, defined by a single question, allows for super flexible and dynamic rearrangements.  When we can easily rearrange and reorganize our writing, then it is easier to meet the audience/user with a more tailored display of what they are looking forward to.  

I appreciate that the human mind is not at risk of maxing out, but it is vital to remember that the limited bandwidth most of us has _does_ drive a competition for our attention.  Minimalism is a fine principle for many aspects of modern life, but writing content stands to benefit exceptionally.
