# Accessibility Ambassadors Presentation 
**Contributed by Megan Lange**

## Overview of Introduction to Cognitive Accessibility for the Web
The intro to cognitive accessibility video is precisely as described in the title. The presenter, Amy Drayer, covers the basics of making accessible content. They are as follows: 
1. Help people understand what things are and how to use them .
2. Help people find what they need. 
3. Use clear and understandable content. 
4. Help people avoid mistakes or correct them. 
5. Help people maintain focus. 
6. Ensure processes do not rely on memory. 
7. Provide help and support. 
8. Support adaptation and personalization. 

Drayer uses these 8 objectives as touchtones throughout her presentation. By focusing on these objects Drayer explains how to best design accessible content. Drayer also outlines some of the most common Cognitive functions to take into consideration when designing web-based content. 
* Short term memory. 
* Different processing speed capabilities. 
* Language restrictions that need simple clear words 
* Social/communication issues needing literal language 
* Dyscalculia (numerical reference confusion) 
* Issues keeping or regaining focus
* Needed support to minimize errors

## Key takeaways
 Things like plain language, limited and simple text blocks, and easy to navigate webpages not only make sites more accessible, but they are also design aspects we can use to improve usability overall. All of the 8 objectives discussed in this video are actionable and straightforward ways to improve any content. Another useful takeaway was Drayer's emphasis on what cognitive functions are most used when using the web and how they are impacted by inaccessible content. 


## Reflection
What resonated with me most from "Intro to Cognitive Accessibility" is how common sense a lot of the changes recommended for making websites more accessible end up being. A lot of it would not only make things more accessible for neurodivergent users, but for the entire general userbase. All of the accessibility ambassador videos are useful for alerting us of some simple and important, but oft forgotten changes we can make to improve our content.
